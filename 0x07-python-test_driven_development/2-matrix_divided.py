    Divides each number in matrix by div, and returns it as the new matrix.
    If one of the elements in the matrix is not a number (int or float),
    TypeError with message "matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of
    integers/floats" is raised. If each list inside the matrix doesn't have
    the same length, a TypeError with message "Each row of the matrix must
    have the same size" is raised. If div is not a number, a TypeError
    exception with the message "div must be a number" is raised. If div is
    equal to 0, ZeroDivisionError with message "division by zero" is raised.

    Args:
        matrix (list): 2D list of numbers
        div (int, float): number that'll divide each number in matrix
    Returns:
        A 2D list of numbers, each the quotient of the respective element
